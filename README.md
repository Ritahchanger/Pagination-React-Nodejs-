# Pagination with React and Node.js

This project demonstrates how to implement pagination using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Pagination is essential for efficiently managing large datasets by dividing them into manageable pages.

## Features

- **Backend (Node.js):**
  - Express.js server to handle API requests.
  - MongoDB database integration for storing and retrieving paginated data.
  - API endpoints for fetching paginated user data.

- **Frontend (React):**
  - React application to display paginated data in a user-friendly interface.
  - Navigation controls (Previous, Next buttons) for easy traversal between pages.
  - Responsive table layout to present data with columns (Name, Username, Email, Address).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running locally or a cloud-hosted MongoDB instance.
- Basic knowledge of React and Node.js.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup (Node.js)
